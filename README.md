# polling-data-analysis
My first public repository written in R - practicing some statistical analysis and data organization things!

The script currently runs a robust linear regression analysis (rlm) on a political candidate's vote % vs. voter turnout at a specific polling station within an electoral district.

Current next steps include adding data visualization to the program to graph out the results

The objective for this program is to build an automated script that will parse through all the CSV files in a folder and identify the candidates that are most likely to do well with increased voter turnout. These candidates will then be cross-referenced against political parties candidates' lists to determine if there are any patterns along party lines.

This information would be useful for political strategists and civic society groups as they try to understand how to further their influence in the political sphere.
